#- Keep the following things in mind when using blocks as part of your interface:
#
#	If you create a collection class that you need to traverse, build on top 
#		of Enumerable rather than reinventing the wheel.
#
#	If you have shared code that differs only in the middle, create a helper
#		method that yields a block in between the pre/postprocessing code
#		to avoid duplication of effort.
#
#	If you use the &block syntax, you can capture the code block provided to 
#		a method inside a variable. You can then store this and use it 
#		later, which is very useful for creating dynamic callbacks.
#
#	Using a combination of &block and instance_eval, you can execute blocks 
#		within the context of arbitrary objects, which opens up a lot of
#		doors for highly customized interfaces.
#
#	The return value of yield (and block.call) is the same as the return
#		value of the provided block.
